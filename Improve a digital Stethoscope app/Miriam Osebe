# Task 1: Introduction

Hello there!

I am Miriam Osebe(she/her). I consider myself a tech enthusiast who only recently set out to pursuing my interest in tech. I have no background in the field but my
enthusiasm fortunately landed me here.

I am excited to be part of this project and i look forward to learning and growing my knowledge in tech through contributing to free and open source software. My interest 
was sparked by my curiosity to learn how to develop a website but i slowly navigated towards data science and machine learning as i realized i enjoy the use of data to 
spot long term problems and develop sustainable solutions for them. My background in quantity surveying had quite a bit of influence in that as i dealt with data 
frequently.

I have had quite a challenging time completing my tasks, albeit their simplicity, as i have no background in tech. A lot of fear for not having enough background knowledge 
in comparison with my counterparts has held me back but i have managed to grasp a number of core concepts in such a short time and i will continue to learn and contribute 
consistently.

I am so glad my acceptance into this phase has pushed me to get out of my comfort zone and kickstarted my journey in tech. I look forward to working with the team.
